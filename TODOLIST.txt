problems:
the offsets of device associations will become invalid if the capturing gui element moves position
associated devices are not released when parent window is changed
window and its top_group cannot easily share dimensions

solution:
remove parent window from gui_element
add parent element to gui_element
gui_elements now request redraws from their parent element
replace windows' top_group with new windowview element
windowview has null element parent, takes a parent window
windowview & parent window adjust each others' dimensions
gui_elements also associate device with parent
creates chain of gui_elements or possibly just live-updatable offsets
windowview takes care of device associations (remove from window)
make sure to implement chain deassociations in parent change (no use cases for carrying support between changes)

>> how will this work with future render caching?

this also allows us to remove minimum window dimensions, as they can be programmatically derived from the contained element constraints

ensure only 1 window::manip at a time, so we can:
isolate window updating within window::manip
have window::manip handle manual (code) window adjustments
have event parser handle passive (WM) window adjustments
... then we can finish fully implementing window actions cleanly

Create event-handler thread ie
    while( !quitFlag() && waitNextEvent( &event ) )
    {
        ...
    }
This is easy enough to support using X, and is pretty much necessary for Cocoa

If the pointer hasn't moved since jadebase initialization, nothing can be
clicked.  Super minor but may have unforseen consequences down the line.
