Remove minimum window dimensions and programmatically derive them from the
windowview's contained element constraints

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure only 1 window::manip at a time, so we can:
  - Isolate window updating within window::manip
  - Have window::manip handle manual (code) window adjustments
  - Have event parser handle passive (WM) window adjustments
... then we can finish fully implementing window actions cleanly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create event-handler thread ie
    while( !quitFlag() && waitNextEvent( &event ) )
    {
        ...
    }
This is easy enough to support using X, and is pretty much necessary for Cocoa

If the pointer hasn't moved since jadebase initialization, nothing can be
clicked.  Super minor but may have unforseen consequences down the line.

Start using 'enum class' and tags at enum uses
  - Start using enum class in your code, if possible

  - Adding a new constant to enum don't forget to correct switch operators

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move event position & modifiers from union types to window_event super struct

Even if a given event doesn't need these, it prevents the wrong union member
from being updated as well as reduces the number of superfluous switch()
statements just to update a pair of values.  It also does not increase the size
of window_event as these members are already included in some union types.

Deprecate gui_element::getVisual***() in favor of more functionally explicit
methods
