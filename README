BQTDraw is a temporary name and will (WILL) be replaced later.  It stands for
Bitmap Quad Tree on which the storage file format is based.

BQTDraw is a program for digital art.  It has two main focuses:
 -  Speediness to allow use on lower-end platforms such as tablets
 -  WYSIWYG format for illustration for print, with possible future support for
    digital-targeted illustration.

BQTDraw will end up sharing significant backbone code with the currently
closed-source CEE [ http://jadematrix.wordpress.com/portfolio/software/cee/ ],
as they share very similar low-level needs and are both primarily authored by
Joseph Durel.

FastFormat by Matthew Wilson is used for text output formatting in place of
std::cout; more info can be found at [ http://fastformat.sourceforge.net/ ].
