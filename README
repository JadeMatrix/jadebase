jadebase is a cross-platform framework for developing professional software
applications in C++ and Lua.  It provides a task-based threading framework and
a GUI system, as well as various utilities.

Threading
    Classes for creating & controlling object-oriented threads, muteces,
    conditions, and semaphores.  In addition, a scoped_lock template class is
    provided for simple & safe lock control.

Tasking
    jadebase is structured to be almost entirely task-based.  By inheriting from
    a base jade::task class, developers can create executable objects to pass to
    a central control system that dispatches to worker threads.

GUI
    Provides a Lua-scriptable GUI system with buttons, sliders, tabs, scrolling,
    groups, and more.

Events
    Unified, cross-platform-safe events, including tablet input

Settings
    Simple interface for storing & loading program settings from .CFG files

Change Tracking
    Unified, opaque multiple undo & redo system
